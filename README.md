> **100% Synthetic. 0% Effort.**

Maintaining a real contribution streak is exhausting. 
Natural streak requires water, sunlight, and effort. **Artificial Turf** requires nothing.

This repository runs a GitHub Action every day to keep my contribution graph green, so I can look like a 10x developer while I'm actually sleeping.

## ⚙️ The Algorithm

1. Checks the end of this file.
